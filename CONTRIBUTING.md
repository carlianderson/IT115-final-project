# Welcome!

Welcome to my final exam assignment repo

## Environment Details

Part of the class is to explore different development enviroments. This repository will be for code contributions from all class members. The class is divided into groups.
There is a directory for group. Each student should only contribute code to the directory for his/her group. The GitHub security model allows each contributor access to the entire repository, but please be responsible and put your code in your assigned directory!

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.
